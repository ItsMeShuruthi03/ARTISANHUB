            Painting and wood sculpture are two distinct yet interconnected forms of artistic expression. Painting
            involves
            applying pigment to a surface, creating vibrant visuals that convey emotions, stories, and ideas through
            color
            and form. Artists use various techniques, from traditional brushwork to contemporary mixed media, to explore
            depth, texture, and movement. Sculptors carve, assemble, and finish wood to create
            dynamic pieces that engage viewers in a tactile experience, inviting them to explore the interplay between
            form
            and space.

            Pottery is a revered art form that involves shaping clay into functional or decorative objects through
            techniques such as hand-building or wheel-throwing. Once formed, the clay pieces are fired in a kiln at high
            temperatures, making them durable and often waterproof. Artists can apply glazes to enhance the aesthetic
            appeal, adding color and texture to the final piece. Pottery holds cultural significance, often reflecting
            the traditions and stories of the communities from which it originates. Today, it remains a popular medium
            for both artisans and hobbyists, blending creativity with craftsmanship.
